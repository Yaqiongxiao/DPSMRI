% Batch script: Extracts networks from grey matter segmentations.
%	Network analyses is done with other scripts.
%
% Depends on:
% - the matlab nifti toolbox, download from: www/mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image
% - the output created with the 'create_cube_template.m script'.
% - SPM5 or SPM8 imcalc function
% - the functions that live in the "ALl_network_scripts" dir:
%	- determine_rois_with_minimum_nz : Determines which template extracts networks of minimum size.
%	- create_rrois : Permutes all the values in the scan.
%	- fast_cross_correlation: Computes the correlation matrices 
%
% PLEASE ADJUST the following lines:
% - line 43: add the path to the directory where you want to store the results
% - line 46: add the full path to the directory were All_network_scripts/functions/ live.
% - line 49: add the full path + file name of the txt file that contains the dir+names of all the scans (1 line per scan)
% - line 52: add the full path of the directory were the resliced images need to be written to.
% - line 55: add the full path of the directory where the spm canonical brain lives.
% - line 58: add the full path of the directory where /bl_ind directory lives, this directory contains the cube templates (output from 'create_cube_template.m')
%
%
%
% Output (stored in the subject directory unless specified otherwise):
% - iso2mm_s (subject number) .img : resliced images (this is stored in designated directory)
% - creates a directory for each subject (1:n). 
% - Sa = 3D volume that contains the MRI data in a matrix form
% - Va = header file that contains the scan info
% - nz = number of cubes (i.e., size of the network)
% - nancount = number of cubes that have standard deviation of 0. (these are excluded from further calculations)
% - off_set = the template used to extract the minimum number of cubes.
% - bind.mat (in single precision): this file contains the indices of the cubes that contain grey matter values
% - rois.mat and rrois.mat (in single precision): these files contain the cubes
% - lookup.mat and rlookup.mat : provide the link between the cubes from rois and rrois and the original scans (bind). These files are needed later when results are written in images (e.g., the degree or clustering values of the cubes).
% - rotcorr.mat and rrcorr.mat (in single precision) are the correlation matrices maximised for with reflection over all angles and rotation with multiples of 45degrees.
% - th = threshold to binarise the matrices: corresponds to the correlation value where in the random image 
% - fp = percentage of positive random correlations
% - sp = sparsity of the matrix with threshold p_corrected = 0.05
